Made by following @MadeByMatt YouTube tutorial.
Added my own minor aesthetic and functionality changes, such as: 

    * Background, square, and title colour/size
    * Enabling the task to be deleted only by clicking the square to complete it 
    * Changing the flex in the task component
    * Adding a plus sign to add a task
